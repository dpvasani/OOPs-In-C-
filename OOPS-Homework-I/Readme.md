The `mutable` keyword in C++ allows a member of an object to be modified even if the object is declared as `const`. This can be particularly useful in situations where you need to modify some internal state that should not affect the visible state of the object.

Here's an example demonstrating the use of the `mutable` keyword:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

class Person {
private:
    string name;
    mutable int accessCount;  // mutable member variable

public:
    Person(const string& name) : name(name), accessCount(0) {}

    // Const member function
    void display() const {
        // Modifying mutable member in a const member function
        ++accessCount;
        cout << "Name: " << name << " (Accessed " << accessCount << " times)" << endl;
    }

    // Getter for accessCount
    int getAccessCount() const {
        return accessCount;
    }
};

int main() {
    const Person person("Alice");

    person.display();
    person.display();
    person.display();

    cout << "Total accesses: " << person.getAccessCount() << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Class Definition (`Person`)**:
   - The class `Person` has two private member variables: `name` and `accessCount`. The `accessCount` is declared as `mutable`.
   - The constructor initializes `name` and `accessCount`.
   - The `display` member function is marked as `const`, meaning it should not modify any member variables of the object. However, it increments the `accessCount` because it is declared as `mutable`.
   - The `getAccessCount` member function is also marked as `const` and returns the `accessCount`.

2. **Main Function**:
   - A `const Person` object is created.
   - The `display` function is called multiple times, each time incrementing the `accessCount` even though the function is `const`.
   - The total access count is printed at the end.

In C++, default arguments in functions allow you to specify a value for an argument that will be used if the caller does not provide that argument. This is particularly useful in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to create flexible and reusable code.

Here's an example demonstrating the use of default arguments in a class function:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Rectangle {
private:
    int length;
    int width;

public:
    // Constructor with default arguments
    Rectangle(int l = 1, int w = 1) {
        length = l;
        width = w;
    }

    // Function to calculate area with a default argument
    int area(int factor = 1) {
        return length * width * factor;
    }

    void display() {
        cout << "Length: " << length << ", Width: " << width << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Creating objects with and without default arguments
    Rectangle rect1;  // Uses default arguments (1, 1)
    Rectangle rect2(5);  // Uses default width argument (5, 1)
    Rectangle rect3(4, 6);  // Uses provided arguments (4, 6)

    rect1.display();
    rect2.display();
    rect3.display();

    // Calculating area with and without default factor
    cout << "Area of rect1: " << rect1.area() << endl;  // Uses default factor 1
    cout << "Area of rect2 with factor 2: " << rect2.area(2) << endl;  // Uses factor 2
    cout << "Area of rect3: " << rect3.area() << endl;  // Uses default factor 1

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Class Definition (`Rectangle`)**:
   - The class `Rectangle` has two private member variables: `length` and `width`.
   - The constructor `Rectangle` has default arguments `l = 1` and `w = 1`, allowing the creation of a `Rectangle` object without specifying any dimensions.
   - The function `area` calculates the area of the rectangle and has a default argument `factor = 1`. This allows scaling the area calculation by a factor if provided.

2. **Main Function**:
   - Different `Rectangle` objects are created using various combinations of default and provided arguments.
   - The `area` function is called with and without the default argument to demonstrate its flexibility.


It looks like you're trying to write a C++ class `abc` with a mix of old style and modern initialization using an initialization list. Let's correct and complete the class definition properly.

Here is the corrected version:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class abc {
    int x;
    int *y;
    const int z;

public:
    // Old style constructor
    abc(int _x, int _y, int _z) {
        x = _x;
        y = new int(_y);
        z = _z;  // Error: cannot assign to a const member after initialization
    }

    // Constructor using initialization list
    abc(int _x, int _y, int _z) : x(_x), y(new int(_y)), z(_z) { }

    // Destructor to clean up dynamically allocated memory
    ~abc() {
        delete y;
    }

    // Function to display the values
    void display() const {
        std::cout << "x: " << x << ", *y: " << *y << ", z: " << z << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Using the old style constructor will not work due to const member initialization
    // abc obj1(10, 20, 30); // Uncommenting this line will cause a compile-time error

    // Using the initialization list constructor
    abc obj2(10, 20, 30);
    obj2.display();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Class Definition (`abc`)**:
   - The class `abc` has three member variables: `x` (an integer), `y` (a pointer to an integer), and `z` (a constant integer).
   - The old style constructor attempts to initialize the member variables within the constructor body. However, initializing `const` members in this manner will cause a compile-time error because `const` members must be initialized when they are declared or in the initialization list.
   - The constructor using an initialization list correctly initializes `x`, `y`, and `z`. The initialization list is the preferred way to initialize `const` members, reference members, and for performance reasons.
   - A destructor is added to clean up the dynamically allocated memory to avoid memory leaks.

2. **Main Function**:
   - An attempt to create an object using the old style constructor is commented out to show that it would cause a compile-time error.
   - An object is created using the initialization list constructor, and the `display` function is called to show the values of the member variables.
