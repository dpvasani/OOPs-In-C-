  // OOPs Homework Level III
  // 1. Abstraction
  // 2. Virtual Keyword
  // Shallow Copy Vs Deep Copy

  // 1. Delivering only essential information to the outer world while masking
  // the background details.

  // 2. It is a design and programming method that separates the interface from
  // the implementation.

  // 3. Real life e.g., various functionalities of AirPods but don't know the
  // actual implementation/ working
  // 1. To drive a car, one only needs to know the driving process and not the
  // mechanics of the car engine

  // Abstraction in Header files
  // 1. Function's implementation is hidden in header files.

  // 2. We could use the same program without knowing its inside working.

  // 3. E.g., Sort0, for example, is used to sort an array, a list, or a
  // collection of items, and we know that if we give a container to sort, it
  // will sort it, but we don't know which sorting algorithm it uses to sort
  // that container.

  // Abstraction using Classes
  // 1. Grouping data members and member functions into classes using access
  // specifiers.
  // 2. A class can choose which data members are visible to the outside world
  // and which are hidden.
